## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository  

This repository was created primarily to provide students with a deeper, more structured understanding of Deep Learning, however it is also useful for anyone interested in the theoretical foundations of Deep Learning.

The goal of these notes is to go beyond the standard course explanations, providing in-depth motivations, detailed derivations and clear connections between concepts. By studying these notes, you can build a **strong foundation** that will help you not only understand existing architectures but also design new ones in the future.


### 📖 Contents of the Repository  

- **Theory Notes:** Detailed notes covering all topics discussed during the course, enriched with additional explanations, insights and clarifications.  
- **References and Further Reading:** Key textbooks and research papers cited throughout the notes to deepen understanding and keep up with current developments in the field.


## 📅 Future Plans  

While this repository currently contains only the theory notes, I plan to gradually add **practical exercises and code examples** whenever I have some free time. These additions will complement the theory and allow you to practice implementing concepts in Python and popular Deep Learning frameworks.
